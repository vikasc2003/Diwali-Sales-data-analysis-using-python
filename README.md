# Diwali-Sales-data-analysis-using-python

Description
This project focuses on analyzing Diwali sales data using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to clean the data, perform exploratory data analysis, and create various bar charts to gain insights into sales patterns based on different categories such as gender, age, amount, states, marital status, and product category.

Key Features


Data Cleaning:
              Explain the process of cleaning the raw data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
              Mention the specific steps taken, such as dropping blank columns and handling missing values.

              
Importing Libraries and Data:
                             Discuss the libraries imported, such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, and their roles in the analysis.
                             Explain how you imported the data from a CSV file into a dataframe (using Pandas) for further processing.

                             
Exploratory Data Analysis:
                          Use df.info() to get an overview of the data, including column names, data types, and non-null counts.
                          Describe the process of identifying and handling missing values, if any.
                          Demonstrate renaming columns using appropriate commands.
                          Utilize df.describe() to generate summary statistics for numerical columns.

                          
Bar Charts:
            Explain how you used bar charts to visualize sales data across different categories.
            Highlight the specific categories analyzed, such as gender, age, amount, states, marital status, and product category.
            Mention the insights gained from these charts, such as identifying the highest-selling products or popular product categories.

            
Jupyter Notebook:
                 Emphasize the use of Jupyter Notebook as the development environment for this project.
                Include any specific instructions or dependencies required for running the notebook.
